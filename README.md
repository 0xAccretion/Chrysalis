# Chrysalis: Cardano Serialization Library for .NET ðŸ¦‹

[![.NET](https://github.com/0xAccretion/Chrysalis/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/0xAccretion/Chrysalis/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

Chrysalis is an open-source .NET library designed to facilitate the serialization and deserialization of Cardano blockchain data structures. With a strong focus on adhering to the Cardano standards and enhancing the .NET Cardano developer ecosystem, Chrysalis aims to provide developers with a reliable and consistent toolkit for working with Cardano.

ðŸš§ **NOTE:** This library is currently a work in progress. Feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Features

- **Cardano Serialization**: Convert Cardano data structures to and from CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation).
- **Bech32 Address Encoding/Decoding**: Handle Cardano addresses seamlessly.
- **Extensive Data Model Support**: Work with a wide range of Cardano data types, including Transactions, Assets, MultiAssets, and more.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Interact with Cardano smart contracts.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Use Chrysalis in any .NET project, including .NET Core, .NET Framework, Xamarin, and more.


## Roadmap ðŸš€

1. **(De)serialization Support**: Achieve complete serialization and deserialization for any Cardano data type described in CDDL https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/blob/master/eras/alonzo/test-suite/cddl-files/alonzo.cddl.
2. **Transaction Handling**: Introduce capabilities for building and signing Cardano transactions.
3. **Advanced Address Management**: Implement address generation, derivation, and other associated functionalities.

## Getting Started

To use Chrysalis in your .NET project:

1. `dotnet add package Chrysalis --version 0.0.6`
2. Example Usage
    
    CBOR (De)serialization
    ```csharp
    var originalTransaction = CborSerializerV2.FromHex<Transaction>(originalTransactionCborHex)!;

    var serializedTransaction = CborSerializerV2.Serialize(originalTransaction);

    var deserializedTransaction = CborSerializerV2.Deserialize<Transaction>(serializedTransaction);
    ```

    Bech32 Address Encoding/Decoding
    ```csharp
    var addressBech32 = "addr...";
    var addressObject = Address.FromBech32(addressBech32);
    var addressBech32Again = addressObject.ToBech32();
    var paymentKeyHash = addressObject.GetPaymentKeyHash();
    var stakeKeyHash = addressObject.GetStakeKeyHash();
    ```
